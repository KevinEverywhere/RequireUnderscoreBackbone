About the Author:

Kevin Ready is a developer who has programmed in a number of languages over the past twenty years. He currently resides in Budapest (July 2013).

This example demonstrates the integration of Require, JQuery, Backbone and Underscore with a degree of complexity. The application flow:

* At static page, underscore templates work with server-side JSON structures to provide localized content.
  - Pull down country menu activates search, results appear below.
  - Pull down language menu changes active language.
* The only element in the raw page is the requireJS stub that looks to scripts/main for initiation.
* scripts/main.js defines the necessary JavaScript files and starts the action by invoking the Front End Controller
* scripts/controller initiates the views, binds events to views, and contains the core business logic
* Localizer provides for the mapping of language with fields, after which the screen is redrawn
* Language and Country demonstrate localization and Ajax mechanisms
* Navigation and Item demonstrate feed rendering, and multiple view-per-model
* Description and Headline are additional child views that share LanguageCollection's localization
* Directory structure follows Backbone/Underscore model/collection/view convention
* libs hold frameworks; collections, models and views hold their respective class definitions
* scripts hold main, controller, countryMap, languageMap and localized
* styles contains a single css file for the application
* templates contain underscoreJS templates as an include_once PHP file

Additional documentation accompanies individual files.
